Strategy Pattern
  -  Constructor Injection.
  -  Basically Vehicle contructor will have the Interface DriveStrategy as an argument.
  -  And all the Car classes will extend this Vehicle Class.
  -  All these car classes in there constructor will call super(new TheirStrategy())
  -  All the car have to make their owen theirStrategy which implements the Interface.

  -  eg: Differnt Vehicle can have different DriveStrategy,
         DriveStrategy.java    // Interface, will have drive()
         RaceCarStrategy.java  // implements interface
         OffRoafStrategy.java  // implements interface
         Vehicle.java          // Vehicle class
            DriveStrategy strategy
            Vehicle(DriveStrategy strategy){
               this.strategy = strategy;    // Constructor injection.
            }
            void drive(){
               strategy.drive();
            }
