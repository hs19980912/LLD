Difference Between Snake and Ladder and TicTacToe:
In tictactoe, the Board used to get changed after every Player's turn
But in Snake and Ladders, board remains fixed during the game,
The position of the players gets changes, hence the position attribute 
would be an attribute of the player and not of the board.

similarity:
in both tictactoe and snake and ladders, we use a deque of players,
and analyze the startGame() always from the prespective of curplayer's turn
ie: curPlayer = deque.fron();
What are the possibility of curPlayer's actions;
